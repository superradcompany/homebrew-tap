    # any install_name_tool edit. That matters on macOS: modifying the binary
    # would invalidate its code signature, and the release binary is signed with
    # the com.apple.security.hypervisor and disable-library-validation
    # entitlements it needs to boot VMs. Leaving the binary untouched preserves
    # the signature and those entitlements; a modified binary would be killed on
    # launch or lose the entitlements.
